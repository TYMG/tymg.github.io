    <p class="about-me-p">My name is Matt Green and I'm a Back End Developer who has been seduced by the world of Web Development</p>

    <p class="about-me-p">I am a 2012 Graduate of the University of Maryland with a degree in Computer Science. After graduating, I became Java
        Developer on projects that heavily utilize the Spring framework. In 2014, I obtained a certificate in Java 7.</p>

    <p class="about-me-p">While there is nothing wrong with Back End Development (I like Hibernate), it isn't "Sexy" as Web Development. So I've
        embarked on a journey to not only be a Web Developer, but a better Developer along the way. IF I can manage to keep
        this thing updated, you can follow along to.</p>

        <p class="about-me-p">Oh yea, I earned the rank of Competent Communicator in Toastmasters International, if that means anything to you.</p>
