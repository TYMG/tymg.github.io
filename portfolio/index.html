                        My personal attempt at building a Simon Game. I used Angular 2 and RxJS to build the game. It was my first experience with
                        Observable, specifically Behavior Subjects. The game works pretty well, but I would like fix some things:
                    </p>
                    <ul>
                        <li>I would like to add sound effects</li>
                        <li>And there is a glitch in the game: While the game works, it works if you press the buttons at a certain pace. If the
                            user presses the buttons to fast, the game will end; even if the user enters the pattern correctly. The reason behind
                            this glitch is the game creates a clock Observable per button click, which counts 2 secs and emits an event. A better
                            way to have done it is to have a global clock, and reset the clock with each click.</li> 
                    </ul>

                       This was my MEVN (Mongo, Express, VUE, Node) project and first attempt at using Webpack. The goal was to create a basic app
                        where I could collect links to the random funky albums that exist on YouTube. The interface is very basic, add, 
                       remove and search. The backend is an Express Server that uses Mongoose to connect MongoDB.
